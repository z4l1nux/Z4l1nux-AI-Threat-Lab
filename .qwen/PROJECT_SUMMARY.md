# Project Summary

## Overall Goal
Implement and improve the threat modeling system to properly parse responses from the local Ollama LLM and generate structured threat analysis reports instead of using mock data.

## Key Knowledge
- The system uses a web interface with TypeScript backend service for threat modeling
- The issue was that responses from Ollama were not being parsed correctly, resulting in fallback to mock data
- The system supports both structured JSON responses and natural language text parsing
- LangChain's ChatOllama is used to interface with the local Ollama model
- The frontend sends threat modeling requests to `/api/threat-modeling` endpoint
- The ThreatModelingService processes AI responses and extracts structured threat information
- Temperature was set to 0.1 for more consistent responses
- Added explicit JSON format instructions in the prompts to encourage structured responses

## Recent Actions
- [DONE] Analyzed the response parsing issue in the ThreatModelingService
- [DONE] Implemented a robust parser to handle various Ollama response formats including "### 1. Ataque de Injeção SQL" pattern
- [DONE] Added support for alternative Ollama formats without numbering
- [DONE] Created sanitizeText helper to clean up formatting from extracted content
- [DONE] Enhanced JSON parsing to handle nested responses like `{response: {message: "..."}}`
- [DONE] Updated threat extraction methods to handle multiple patterns and fallbacks
- [DONE] Added explicit JSON format instructions in all threat modeling prompts
- [DONE] Fixed TypeScript compilation errors from incorrect Ollama configuration options
- [DONE] Modified server to use temperature parameter instead of unsupported format/options

## Current Plan
- [DONE] Improve Ollama response parsing to handle structured outputs
- [DONE] Implement robust text parsing for non-JSON responses
- [DONE] Update prompts to encourage JSON structured responses
- [DONE] Test implementation to verify parsing improvements work correctly
